# Todoer

This is a quick python script used to display a todolist GUI on a IOT Raspberry Pi display. It uses the Todoist API and is able to relay/sync tasks back and forth.

If you want to use this for your own projects/IOT, go ahead. Remember to replace "API_KEY_HERE" with your todoist api key in main.py. (Your Todoist API Key can be found [here](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer))

The touchscreen that I used for this project is found [here](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-pi-tft43-v2-0-screen-board?_pos=1&_sid=95d51ebd5&_ss=r)
