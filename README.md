# Todoer

This is a quick python script used to display a todolist GUI on a IOT Raspberry Pi display. It uses the Todoist API and is able to relay/sync tasks back and forth.

If you want to use this for your own projects/IOT, go ahead. Remember to replace "API_KEY_HERE" with your todoist api key in main.py. (Your Todoist API Key can be found [here](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer))
